			<p>I was born and raised in Pasadena, California. I studied communications and spanish at UCLA and secondary education at Loyola Marymount. I used to be a teacher, now I am a co-founder for <a href="http://mackeycreativelab.com/">Mackey Creative Lab</a>. </p><p>That's my background, but this is who I am. I like organizing things, trying to figure stuff out, and working with others. I like when things are neat and tidy, but I can't guarantee that they always are. I love to talk and laugh, though I usually do both too loudly. I love sports, but have never been the next star athlete. I like to sing along to songs, even though I mess up the words and sound horrible. I have a big family who are the most important thing to me, just as they are. I love life, the ups and the downs and usually see the best of things.</p>

					<h4> Project Management</h4>
					<p> Telling people what to do is not being bossy, if it's your job (right?). I spend a lot of time talking to clients and figuring out their project needs. I set dates and deadlines, make lists, and create plans. I do what I can to help see a project from start to finish.</p>

					<img src="images/design.jpeg" alt="samples of my design">

					<h4>Designing</h4>
					<p>With no "formal" training, design is something I am trying to develop. Invitations for weddings and parties are my favorite. T-shirts for too many adult kickball teams (yes, you read that right) is what i've done. Website design is what I'm trying to figure out.</p>

					<h4>Spinning Instructor</h4>
					<p>Exercise is something I do, not necessarily something I love. But, becoming an indoor cyclying teacher has made it my job-- and I actually like it. I make playlists that are fun and diverse, motivate participants to finish the ride and breake a major sweat while I'm at it. And no, that's not the bike I use.</p>

					<img src="images/typewriter.jpg" alt="typewriter">
				
					<h4>Creating</h4>
					<p>I am not a skilled writer - though there's something about grammar rules that I like. When it comes to getting content for a website, I can get it done. I sometimes write it myself. Many times I revise what's already there. The best times are when I just dump in what's already there.</p>
