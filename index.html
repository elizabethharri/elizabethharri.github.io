			<p>I was born and raised in Pasadena, California. I studied communications and spanish at UCLA and secondary education at Loyola Marymount. I used to be a teacher, now I am a co-founder for <a href="http://mackeycreativelab.com/">Mackey Creative Lab</a>. </p><p>That's my background, but this is who I am. I like to organize things, I like to try to figure stuff out, and I like to work with others. I like when things are neat and tidy, but I keep myself too busy so if you walk into my house mid-week it will probably be messy. I love to talk and laugh, though I usually do both too loudly. I love sports- playing, watching, listening, though I have never nor will never be the next star athlete. I like to sing along to songs, though I usually mess up the words and always sound horrible. I have a big family who are the most important thing to me - even if we are a bunch of weirdos. I love laugh, the ups and the dowms and usually see the best of things.</p>

					<h4> Project Management</h4>
					<p> Telling people what to do is not being bossy, if it's your job (right?). I spend a lot of time talking to clients and figuring out their project needs. I set dates and deadlines, make lists, and create plans. I do what I can to help see a project from start to finish.</p>

					<h4>Designing</h4>
					<p>With no "formal" training, design is something I am trying to develop. Invitations for weddings and parties are my favorite. T-shirts for too many adult kickball teams (yes, you read that right) is what i've done. Website design is what I'm trying to figure out.</p>

					<h4>Spinning Instructor</h4>
					<p>Exercise is something I do, not necessarily something I love. But, becoming an indoor cyclying teacher has made it my job-- and I actually like it. I make playlists that are fun and diverse, motivate participants to finish the ride and breake a major sweat while I'm at it. And no, that's not the bike I use.</p>

					<h4>Creating</h4>
					<p>I am not a skilled writer - though there's something about grammar rules that I like. When it comes to getting content for a website, I can get it done. I sometimes write it myself. Many times I revise what's already there. The best times are when I just dump in what's already there.</p>
